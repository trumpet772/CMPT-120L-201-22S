    "The second assignment should also be fairly simple. We’re going to be looking at the doc on getting your forked repo synced with mine. I’d advise that you download [GitHub Desktop | Simple collaboration from your desktop.](https://desktop.github.com/) Considering dealing with terminals has been a little tedious. As shown in class it is possible to do these things in the terminal. We may want to revisit that a little further into class when people are a little more comfortable if they’d like.\n",
    "\n",
    "After doing so we need to clone your forked repo and then sync it. To do this you can follow the steps here. [Cloning a repository from GitHub to GitHub Desktop.](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop) After you clone you can look into this guide to [How to sync your forked repo with original Repo in Github Desktop.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46110615/how-to-sync-your-forked-repo-with-original-repo-in-github-desktop)\n",

    "After that you’ll need to push the changes that you synced so that I can see them and you can get credit and that is here. [Pushing changes to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/pushing-changes-to-github)\n",
    "\n",
    "Grading will be based on content, accuracy, thoroughness, and adherence to instructions for credit up to a single homework assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "First submit the assignment by pushing your synced repository to your GitHub account on [https://github.com/](https://github.com/). You’ll know if you did this properly because you’ll have the Lesson Two notebook. You’ll also have the file for the lab. Second, on iLearn, submit the assignment with a screenshot of your synced repo on Github.\n"
